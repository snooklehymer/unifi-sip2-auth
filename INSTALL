Install instructions for unifi-sip2-auth.
-------------------------------------------

The setup assumes you have apache (or webserver or your choice) installed and configured for your site's 
virutal host ('guest/s/$site/'), cgi etc.

You should also have perl, cgi, and mysql install/configured.

The following packages are required. Use your package manager to install. Avoid installing from
CPAN if you can!

apt-get install libcgi-session-perl \
libtemplate-perl \
libconfig-tiny-perl \
libdbi-perl \
libcrypt-blowfish-perl \ 
libauthen-passphrase-perl \
libhttp-cookies-perl \
liblwp-protocol-https-perl \
libcrypt-ssleay-perl \
libwww-perl \
libjson-xs-perl

Extract the tarball to the root of your web directory (or wherever your unif base will be) and change directory to it.

create a mysql database called 'unifi' and grant permissions (change dbname and users as required!),
substitiute root for your username if required:

 - mysql -uroot -p
 - create database unifi;
 - grant all on unifi.* to 'unifi'@'localhost' identified by 'unifi';
 - \q
 - mysql -uroot -p unifi < unifi-sip2-auth.sql
 
If you have chosen a different dbname and/or user/pass you will need to edit config/config to reflect.

You can now delete the unifi-sip2-auth.sql and tar files

Configure your apache host. Below is a sample config and you really should modify this for you needs/security.
It should work though, for testing at least:

### Start Apache conf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin unifi-admin@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/unifi
    <Directory /var/www/unifi/guest/s/default>
        DirectoryIndex index.pl
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .pl
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
### End Apache conf


Point your browser at http://yourhost/guest/s/$site/admin.pl

default username: admin
default password: admin

Once logged in you can use the GUI to configure your SIP server and Unifi Controller settings.

SIP log file is written to /tmp/unifi.siptrace


------------------------
SIP Valitaion rules 
------------------------
The service can check SIP2 attributes and, based on their contents, allow/deny access to the controller.
An example might be for an EXPIRED USER, a certain PATRON CODE or a PATRON under a certain age. These
rules (at the moment) are configured via mysql in the unifi.sip_validation_rules table. There are some default
rules in place as shown here:

+----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+---------+------+
| sip_code | conditions  | value         | actions | message                                 | role_id | ord  |
+----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+---------+------+
| BL       | equal       | N             |       3 | Invalid Username or Password            |       1 |    1 |
| CQ       | equal       | N             |       3 | Invalid Username or Password            |       1 |    2 |
| AF       | starts_with | #User expired |       3 | Your account has expired                |    NULL |    3 |
| AF       | equal       | User BARRED   |       3 | Account Barred                          |    NULL |    4 |
| PD       | less_than   | 14            |       3 | You must be over 14 to use this network |       1 |    5 |
| PC       | equal       | J             |       3 | Account not allowed on wireless network |       0 |    6 |
| BL       | equal       | Y             |       0 |                                         |       2 |    7 |
+----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-----------------------------------------+---------+------+

It is important to leave the first two rows inplace (BL->N and CQ->N)  and the last row (BL->Y) as these are standard values 
to check for a valid user. The rest of the the rules are processed in order of their ord value. You can add, modify or delete 
any rule not equal to 1,2 or 7 (or the last ord value if you create your own rules) you should keep the ord values in sequence 
(although not required!), being careful to leave BL->Y as the last value. 
** role_id can be NULL - it is not used at present.
